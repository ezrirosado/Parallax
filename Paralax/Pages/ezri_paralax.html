		<h2>"Ooh, Shiny!"</h2>
		<p>Quasars are an extremely luminous astronomical objects found in the center of galaxies. They're formed when gas revolves at a rapid speed around and into a supermassive black hole that could be several hundreds or thousands times as massive as our sun. The brightest quasars can outshine all of the stars in their galaxies which makes them visible from up to billions of lightyears away. They are known to be the brightest known objects in the entire universe. Some quasars can even be faintly seen from Earth.

		<h2>"Chemical Boom!!"</h2>
		<p>A supernova is an event that marks the cataclysmic end of a star's life. After a star starts dying out it begins to slowly lose pressure up until the point gravity can take control and begin shrinking the star. This shrinkage will continue to happen until the dying star finally collapses on itself. This collapse is what triggers the explosion we call a supernova. These are the largest explosions that humans have ever witnessed are thought to have caused the creation of the elements heavier than iron on the periodic table.

		<h2>"Aww, tiny!"</h2>
		<p>Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars that are extremely dense. These stars are almost entirely composed of neutrons, hence the name. Pulsars can have a diameter of only about 20 miles or less, but can have masses of up to twice that of our own sun. These stars are formed when the core of a supernova collapses in on itself. The neutrons at the surface of the star decay into protons and electrons and create an extremely intense magnetic field. As the star accelerates to speeds that almost reach the speed of light its particles give off electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is released as beams shooting off the poles of the star.
